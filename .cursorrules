## Database Rules
- **CRITICAL: ONLY use Supabase Cloud Database** - Never connect to local databases
- Always use `public` schema for tables (not `api`)
- Use UUID for primary keys with `gen_random_uuid()`
- Follow existing enum patterns: `app_role`, `merchant_status`, `subscription_plan`
- Use `WHERE NOT EXISTS` instead of `ON CONFLICT` for safe insertions
- Loyalty card numbers: 8 characters, first character is user's initial (e.g., J0000001)
- All database operations must use the cloud Supabase instance at `wndswqvqogeblksrujpg.supabase.co`

## Database Connection Requirements
- **MANDATORY: Use Supabase Cloud Database Only**
  - URL: `https://wndswqvqogeblksrujpg.supabase.co`
  - Anon Key: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6InduZHN3cXZxb2dlYmxrc3J1anBnIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTYzMzEyMTAsImV4cCI6MjA3MTkwNzIxMH0.eOXJEo3XheuB2AK3NlRotSKqPMueqkgPUa896TM-hfA`
- **NEVER use local PostgreSQL connections**
- **NEVER use localhost database connections**
- All SQL scripts and database operations must target the cloud instance
- When creating tables, functions, or policies, use Supabase migrations or direct cloud connection

## Supabase CLI Usage Rules
- **MANDATORY: Use Supabase CLI for Database Operations**
  - Install Supabase CLI: `npm install -g supabase`
  - Initialize project: `supabase init`
  - Link to cloud project: `supabase link --project-ref wndswqvqogeblksrujpg`
  - Apply migrations: `supabase db push`
  - Execute SQL scripts: `supabase db reset` or `supabase db push`
- **Database Migration Workflow:**
  1. Create migration files in `supabase/migrations/`
  2. Use `supabase db push` to apply to cloud database
  3. Verify changes with `supabase db diff`
  4. Always test migrations before applying to production
- **Project Reference:** `wndswqvqogeblksrujpg` (from Supabase URL)
- **Migration File Naming:** `YYYYMMDD_description.sql`
- **Always backup before major migrations**

## Code Style
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing component patterns in `src/components/`
- Use proper error handling with try-catch blocks
- Include proper TypeScript types for all functions

## SQL Best Practices
- Always check table structure before writing INSERT statements
- Use proper column names from actual database schema
- Include verification queries after data insertion
- Use `NOT EXISTS` for safe duplicate prevention

## Testing
- Create comprehensive test data with realistic values
- Include both custodial and non-custodial NFT types
- Test different subscription plans and user roles
- Verify all foreign key relationships
