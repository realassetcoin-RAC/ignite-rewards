# Shop Plan Schema Fix Guide

## üö® Error: "Failed to save plan: the schema must be one of the following:api"

### Problem Description

You're encountering this error when trying to create a new plan under the shop tab. This error indicates a database schema configuration issue where the application is trying to access the `merchant_subscription_plans` table, but there's a mismatch between the expected schema and the actual database configuration.

### Root Cause

The error occurs because:

1. **Schema Mismatch**: The `merchant_subscription_plans` table may be in the wrong schema (api vs public)
2. **Missing Permissions**: The table exists but lacks proper RLS policies or permissions
3. **Table Structure Issues**: The table structure doesn't match what the application expects
4. **Admin Role Issues**: Your user may not have the proper admin role to create plans

## üîß Solution

### Option 1: Automated Fix (Recommended)

1. **Run the automated script**:
   ```bash
   ./apply_shop_plan_fix.sh
   ```

2. **Enter your Supabase database URL** when prompted (found in Supabase project settings)

3. **The script will automatically apply all necessary fixes**

### Option 2: Manual Fix via Supabase Dashboard

1. **Open the HTML tool**:
   - Open `shop_plan_fix_tool.html` in your browser
   - Follow the step-by-step instructions

2. **Or apply the SQL directly**:
   - Go to your Supabase project dashboard
   - Navigate to the SQL Editor
   - Copy and paste the contents of `fix_shop_plan_schema_error.sql`
   - Click "Run"

### Option 3: Diagnostic First

If you want to understand the current state before applying the fix:

1. **Run the diagnostic script**:
   - Copy and paste the contents of `diagnose_shop_plan_error.sql` into Supabase SQL Editor
   - This will show you exactly what's wrong

2. **Then apply the appropriate fix**

## üìã What the Fix Does

### 1. **Recreates the Table**
- Drops and recreates `merchant_subscription_plans` in the `public` schema
- Ensures proper table structure with all required columns

### 2. **Sets Up RLS Policies**
- Creates comprehensive Row Level Security policies
- Allows admins to manage plans
- Allows authenticated users to view active plans

### 3. **Grants Permissions**
- Gives authenticated users proper access to the table
- Ensures sequences and other database objects are accessible

### 4. **Creates Indexes**
- Adds performance indexes for common queries
- Improves query speed for plan lookups

### 5. **Inserts Default Data**
- Creates sample subscription plans (Basic, Premium, Enterprise)
- Provides a starting point for your subscription system

### 6. **Ensures Profiles Table**
- Creates or verifies the `profiles` table exists in `public` schema
- Sets up admin role checking functionality

## üîç Verification Steps

After applying the fix, verify it worked:

### 1. **Check in Supabase SQL Editor**
```sql
-- These should all return results without errors
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.merchant_subscription_plans;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.profiles;
```

### 2. **Check Your User Role**
```sql
-- Make sure you have admin role
SELECT id, email, role FROM public.profiles WHERE id = auth.uid();
```

### 3. **Test in Application**
- Refresh your application
- Go to the shop tab
- Try creating a new plan
- The error should be resolved

## üö® Troubleshooting

### If you still see errors after applying the fix:

#### 1. **Check User Role**
```sql
-- Ensure your user has admin role
UPDATE public.profiles 
SET role = 'admin' 
WHERE id = auth.uid() AND email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

#### 2. **Clear Browser Cache**
- Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Clear application cache if using a PWA

#### 3. **Check Browser Console**
- Open developer tools (F12)
- Look for any JavaScript errors
- Check network tab for failed API calls

#### 4. **Verify Table Access**
```sql
-- Check if you can access the table
SELECT * FROM public.merchant_subscription_plans LIMIT 1;
```

#### 5. **Check RLS Policies**
```sql
-- Verify RLS policies exist
SELECT policyname, permissive, roles, cmd, qual 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' AND tablename = 'merchant_subscription_plans';
```
