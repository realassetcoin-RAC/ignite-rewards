# Virtual Cards Custom Type Error Fix Summary

## Problem Description

The error "failed to save virtual card could not find the custom_card_type column of the virtual_cards in the schema cache" was occurring when trying to create virtual cards through the admin dashboard.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue had two main causes:

### 1. Non-existent Database Column
The frontend `VirtualCardManager` component was trying to submit a `custom_card_type` field to the database, but this column doesn't exist in the `virtual_cards` table schema. The `custom_card_type` field is purely a UI element used to capture user input for custom card types.

### 2. Schema Type Mismatch
There was inconsistency in the database schema:
- Some migrations defined `card_type` as an enum with values like `('loyalty')`
- Other migrations converted it to TEXT to support custom types
- The TypeScript types were expecting enum values, but the actual database might have had TEXT
- The frontend was using outdated enum values like `"standard"` and `"premium"` that weren't in the current enum definition

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Frontend Code Fix
**File: `src/components/admin/VirtualCardManager.tsx`**

- **Fixed form submission**: Changed from spreading all form data (`...data`) to explicitly selecting only database fields, excluding UI-only fields like `custom_card_type` and `custom_plan`
- **Updated enum values**: Changed from `"standard"` and `"premium"` to valid enum values: `"loyalty"`
- **Updated dropdown options**: Modified the select options to use the correct enum values

### 2. Database Schema Fix
**File: `supabase/migrations/20250130000000_fix_virtual_cards_custom_card_type_error.sql`**

- **Standardized card_type column**: Converted `card_type` from enum to TEXT in both `public` and `api` schemas to support custom types
- **Schema consistency**: Ensured consistent structure across both schemas
- **Data migration**: Safely migrated existing data, converting old enum values to appropriate TEXT values
- **RLS policies**: Updated Row Level Security policies to work with the new schema

### 3. TypeScript Types Update
**File: `src/integrations/supabase/types.ts`**

- **Updated type definitions**: Changed `card_type` from `Database["public"]["Enums"]["card_type"]` to `string` to reflect the TEXT column type

## Files Modified

1. **`src/components/admin/VirtualCardManager.tsx`**
   - Fixed form data submission to exclude UI-only fields
   - Updated default values and dropdown options to use correct enum values

2. **`src/integrations/supabase/types.ts`**
   - Updated TypeScript types for `card_type` from enum to string

3. **`supabase/migrations/20250130000000_fix_virtual_cards_custom_card_type_error.sql`** (NEW)
   - Comprehensive database migration to fix schema issues

4. **`apply_virtual_cards_custom_type_fix.sh`** (NEW)
   - Script to apply the migration and verify the fix

## How the Fix Works

### Before the Fix
```javascript
// Frontend was sending this data:
const cardData = {
  ...data, // This included custom_card_type and custom_plan
  card_type: finalCardType,
  // ... other fields
};
```

### After the Fix
```javascript
// Frontend now sends only database fields:
const cardData = {
  card_name: data.card_name,
  card_type: finalCardType, // This is now TEXT, supports custom types
  description: data.description,
  // ... only actual database columns
};
```

### Custom Type Handling
1. User selects "custom" from dropdown
2. User enters custom type name (e.g., "VIP", "Corporate", "Student")
3. Frontend processes the custom type and sets `finalCardType` to the custom value
4. Only the processed `finalCardType` is sent to the database as `card_type`
5. The UI-only `custom_card_type` field is never sent to the database

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Apply the Migration
```bash
# Run the migration script
./apply_virtual_cards_custom_type_fix.sh

# Or manually apply the migration
psql $DATABASE_URL -f supabase/migrations/20250130000000_fix_virtual_cards_custom_card_type_error.sql
```

### 2. Verify the Fix
```sql
-- Run the verification function
SELECT api.test_virtual_cards_fix();
```

### 3. Test in Admin Dashboard
1. Go to the admin dashboard
2. Try creating a new virtual card
3. Test both standard types (loyalty) and custom types
4. Verify that cards are created successfully without schema errors

## Expected Results

- ✅ Virtual card creation should work without "custom_card_type column" errors
- ✅ Both standard and custom card types should be supported
- ✅ Existing virtual cards should continue to work normally
- ✅ Admin users should be able to create, edit, and delete virtual cards

## Preventive Measures

1. **Form Data Validation**: The frontend now explicitly defines which fields to send to the database
2. **Type Safety**: Updated TypeScript types ensure compile-time checking
3. **Schema Consistency**: Migration ensures both public and api schemas are consistent
4. **Testing Function**: Created verification function to test the fix

## Rollback Plan (if needed)

If issues arise, you can:

1. Revert the TypeScript types changes
2. Revert the frontend component changes
3. Run a rollback migration to restore enum types (if needed)

The migration is designed to be safe and preserve existing data, but always backup your database before applying major schema changes.
