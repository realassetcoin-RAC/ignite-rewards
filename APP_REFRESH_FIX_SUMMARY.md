# App Refresh Fix - Complete Solution

## üéØ Problem Solved
Your app was refreshing when switching between applications due to multiple factors causing unnecessary re-renders and state updates.

## üîß Root Causes Identified & Fixed

### 1. **React Query Auto-Refetching** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: React Query was configured with default settings that automatically refetch data when the window regains focus.

**Solution**: Updated `src/App.tsx` with optimized QueryClient configuration:
```typescript
const queryClient = new QueryClient({
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      refetchOnWindowFocus: false,    // Prevents refetch on focus
      refetchOnMount: false,          // Prevents refetch on mount
      refetchOnReconnect: false,      // Prevents refetch on reconnect
      staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000,      // 5 minutes cache
      cacheTime: 10 * 60 * 1000,     // 10 minutes cache
    },
  },
});
```

### 2. **Supabase Auth Auto-Refresh** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: Supabase was configured to auto-refresh tokens and detect session changes from URL, causing auth state updates.

**Solution**: Updated `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts`:
```typescript
export const supabase = createClient<Database>(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY, {
  auth: {
    storage: localStorage,
    persistSession: true,
    autoRefreshToken: true,
    detectSessionInUrl: false,  // Prevents auth changes from URL
    flowType: 'pkce',          // Better security and stability
  },
  // ... rest of config
});
```

### 3. **Auth State Over-Updates** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: The `useSecureAuth` hook was updating auth state on every auth event, even minor ones.

**Solution**: Enhanced `src/hooks/useSecureAuth.ts` with smart update logic:
- Added window focus/blur tracking
- Implemented debouncing (5-second minimum between updates)
- Only updates on significant events (SIGNED_IN, SIGNED_OUT, TOKEN_REFRESHED)
- Prevents updates when window is focused unless necessary

### 4. **Wallet Provider Initialization** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: Wallet providers were initializing multiple times and causing re-renders.

**Solution**: Added debouncing to both wallet providers:
- `src/components/PhantomWalletProvider.tsx`
- `src/components/MetaMaskProvider.tsx`
- 100ms debounce prevents multiple rapid initializations

### 5. **Global App Stability** ‚úÖ ADDED
**Problem**: No global mechanism to prevent app refreshes on window focus.

**Solution**: Created `src/hooks/useAppStability.ts`:
- Tracks window focus/blur events
- Prevents rapid focus event processing
- Handles visibility changes and page show/hide events
- Integrated into main App component

## üìÅ Files Modified

1. **src/App.tsx** - React Query configuration + app stability hook
2. **src/integrations/supabase/client.ts** - Supabase auth optimization
3. **src/hooks/useSecureAuth.ts** - Smart auth state management
4. **src/hooks/useAppStability.ts** - NEW: Global app stability management
5. **src/components/PhantomWalletProvider.tsx** - Debounced initialization
6. **src/components/MetaMaskProvider.tsx** - Debounced initialization

## üß™ How to Test

### Method 1: Manual Testing
1. Open your app in a browser
2. Navigate to any page (dashboard, admin panel, etc.)
3. Switch to another application (Alt+Tab or click another app)
4. Wait 5-10 seconds
5. Switch back to your app
6. **Expected Result**: App should NOT refresh, maintain state, no loading spinners

### Method 2: Browser DevTools
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Switch between apps
4. **Expected Result**: You should see console logs like:
   - "Window focused (1), preventing unnecessary refreshes"
   - "Window blurred, maintaining app state"
   - "Tab became visible, maintaining app state"

### Method 3: Network Tab
1. Open DevTools ‚Üí Network tab
2. Switch between apps
3. **Expected Result**: No new network requests should appear when switching back

## üöÄ Additional Benefits

- **Better Performance**: Reduced unnecessary API calls
- **Improved UX**: No loading states when switching apps
- **Battery Saving**: Less CPU usage from reduced re-renders
- **Stable State**: Form data, scroll positions, and UI state preserved

## üîç Troubleshooting

If the issue persists:

1. **Check Console**: Look for any error messages
2. **Clear Cache**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. **Check Network**: Ensure no failed requests
4. **Verify Changes**: Confirm all files were saved correctly

## üìù Technical Details

The solution works by:
1. **Preventing React Query** from auto-refetching on window focus
2. **Debouncing auth updates** to prevent rapid state changes
3. **Optimizing Supabase** to reduce unnecessary session checks
4. **Adding global stability** to handle all window focus scenarios
5. **Debouncing wallet providers** to prevent multiple initializations

This comprehensive approach addresses all known causes of app refreshes when switching between applications.
