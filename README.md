# RAC Rewards Platform

This repository contains the RAC Rewards web app and backend schema: loyalty dashboards, Admin panel, Contact system, DAO governance, Marketplace, and Solana rewards integrations.

## Quick Start

1) Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

2) Configure Supabase env (create `.env` in project root)
```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

3) Apply database migrations (recommended)
Use your preferred workflow to apply SQL files in `supabase/migrations/` to your Supabase project (order by filename).

4) Run the app
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Feature Matrix

- Auth and roles: Supabase auth, robust admin checks
- Admin Panel: virtual cards, merchants, referrals, rewards, marketplace, users, health, errors, settings
- Contact System: AI chatbot + email, tickets, attachments, categories/tags, Slack notifications
