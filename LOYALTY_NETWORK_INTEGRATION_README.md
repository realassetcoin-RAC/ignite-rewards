# üîó Loyalty Network Integration Feature

## Overview

The Loyalty Network Integration feature allows users to link their third-party loyalty accounts (Starbucks, McDonald's, etc.) to the platform and convert their points into platform tokens. This feature includes comprehensive admin management, OTP verification, and DAO governance integration.

## üéØ User Story Implementation

### ‚úÖ Functional Requirements Completed

1. **User Dashboard Integration**
   - New "Loyalty Networks" section in user dashboard
   - Dropdown menu of approved third-party loyalty networks
   - Mobile number input for account linking
   - OTP verification system with pop-up screens
   - Point balance display and conversion interface
   - Confirmation dialogs for point conversion

2. **Admin Requirements**
   - Complete admin interface for managing loyalty networks
   - Add, edit, and remove third-party loyalty networks
   - Set conversion rates for each network
   - Manage network settings and API configurations

3. **DAO Integration**
   - All loyalty network changes require DAO approval
   - Automatic proposal creation for network additions/updates/removals
   - Governance integration following project conventions

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Database Schema

The system uses 5 main tables:

1. **`loyalty_networks`** - Third-party loyalty network configurations
2. **`user_loyalty_links`** - User connections to loyalty networks
3. **`loyalty_otp_sessions`** - OTP verification sessions
4. **`loyalty_point_conversions`** - Point conversion transactions
5. **`loyalty_point_balances`** - Point balance snapshots

### Key Components

1. **`LoyaltyNetworkManager.tsx`** - Admin interface for network management
2. **`LoyaltyAccountLinking.tsx`** - User interface for linking accounts
3. **`PointConversionSystem.tsx`** - Point conversion and balance management
4. **`loyaltyOtp.ts`** - OTP generation and verification logic
5. **`thirdPartyLoyaltyApi.ts`** - API integration layer for third-party providers

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Apply Database Migration

```bash
# Set your Supabase service role key
export SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="your_service_role_key"

# Run the migration
node apply_loyalty_network_migration.js
```

### 2. Access Admin Interface

1. Log in as an admin user
2. Navigate to Admin Dashboard
3. Click on the "Loyalty Networks" tab
4. Add and configure third-party loyalty networks

### 3. User Experience

1. Users access the "Loyalty Networks" section in their dashboard
2. Select a loyalty network from the dropdown
3. Enter their mobile number
4. Receive and verify OTP
5. View point balance and convert points to platform tokens

## üîß Configuration

### Default Networks

The system comes pre-configured with popular loyalty networks:

- **Starbucks Rewards** (1.0x conversion rate)
- **McDonald's App** (0.8x conversion rate)
- **Subway Rewards** (1.2x conversion rate)
- **Dunkin' Rewards** (0.9x conversion rate)
- **Pizza Hut Rewards** (1.1x conversion rate)

### Conversion Rates

Each network has configurable:
- Conversion rate (points to tokens multiplier)
- Minimum conversion amount
- Maximum conversion amount
- Mobile verification requirements

## üîê Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)

All tables implement comprehensive RLS policies:
- Users can only access their own loyalty links
- Admins can manage all networks and view all data
- Public read access for active networks only

### OTP Verification

- 6-digit OTP codes with 10-minute expiration
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Automatic cleanup of expired sessions
- Mobile number validation

### API Security

- Encrypted API key storage
- Secure third-party API integration
- Transaction logging and audit trails

## üé® User Interface

### Admin Dashboard

- **Loyalty Networks Tab**: Complete CRUD interface for network management
- **Network Configuration**: API endpoints, conversion rates, limits
- **Status Management**: Active/inactive network toggles
- **DAO Integration**: Automatic proposal creation for changes

### User Dashboard

- **Loyalty Networks Section**: New dedicated section for account linking
- **Network Selection**: Visual cards showing available networks
- **OTP Verification**: Clean pop-up interface for mobile verification
- **Point Conversion**: Interactive slider for conversion amounts
- **Transaction History**: Recent conversion tracking

## üîÑ Workflow

### Account Linking Process

1. User selects a loyalty network
2. Enters mobile number associated with their account
3. System generates and sends OTP (currently logged to console)
4. User enters OTP for verification
5. Account is linked and verified
6. User can now view balance and convert points

### Point Conversion Process

1. User views their linked accounts and current balances
2. Selects amount to convert (within min/max limits)
3. System calls third-party API to redeem points
4. Platform tokens are credited to user account
5. Transaction is recorded for audit purposes

### Admin Management Process

1. Admin adds new loyalty network with configuration
2. System automatically creates DAO proposal for approval
3. Once approved, network becomes available to users
4. Admin can update settings (triggers new DAO proposal)
5. Admin can deactivate networks (triggers DAO proposal)

## üß™ Testing

### Development Testing

The system includes simulated API responses for development:

```javascript
// Example API response simulation
{
  stars: Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000) + 100,
  status: 'active'
}
```

### Production Setup

For production, you'll need to:

1. **Configure Real APIs**: Update API endpoints in network configurations
2. **Set up SMS Service**: Integrate with Twilio, AWS SNS, or similar
3. **Encrypt API Keys**: Implement proper encryption for third-party credentials
4. **Monitor Transactions**: Set up logging and monitoring for conversions

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics

- Number of linked accounts per network
- Conversion rates and volumes
- Failed verification attempts
- API response times and errors

### Admin Insights

- Network performance metrics
- User adoption rates

2. **Conversion Scheduling**: Schedule conversions for optimal rates
3. **Network Recommendations**: Suggest networks based on user spending
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Detailed conversion and usage analytics
5. **Mobile App Integration**: Native mobile app support

### API Integrations

// Generate OTP
const result = await generateLoyaltyOTP(userId, networkId, mobileNumber);

// Verify OTP
const verified = await verifyLoyaltyOTP(userId, networkId, mobileNumber, otpCode);

// Check point balance
const balance = await checkPointBalance(userId, networkId, mobileNumber);

// Convert points
const conversion = await convertPointsToTokens(userId, networkId, mobileNumber, points);
```

### Admin Operations
