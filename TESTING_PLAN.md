# üß™ COMPREHENSIVE TESTING PLAN

## Purpose
This document provides step-by-step testing procedures to verify that implemented features actually work, not just exist as code.

## ‚úÖ NEWLY IMPLEMENTED FEATURES TO TEST

### 1. AUTOMATIC WALLET CREATION & LOYALTY NUMBER GENERATION

**Test Steps:**
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:8084`
2. Click "Sign Up" or find customer signup button
3. Fill out signup form with test data:
   - Name: "John Test"
   - Email: "john.test@example.com" 
   - Password: "test123"
   - Accept both terms checkboxes
4. Submit form

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Success message shows loyalty number starting with "J" (user's initial)
- ‚úÖ Loyalty number is 8 characters: `J[6-digits][1-digit]`
- ‚úÖ Console logs show wallet creation
- ‚úÖ Console logs show loyalty card assignment
- ‚úÖ No errors in browser console

**Verification Queries:**
```sql
-- Check wallet was created
SELECT * FROM user_wallets WHERE user_id = '[new_user_id]';

-- Check loyalty card was created  
SELECT * FROM user_loyalty_cards WHERE user_id = '[new_user_id]';
```

### 2. TERMS ACCEPTANCE VALIDATION

**Test Steps:**
1. Start signup process
2. Fill form but DO NOT check terms boxes
3. Try to submit

**Expected Results:**
- ‚ùå Form should NOT submit
- ‚ùå Error message: "Please accept the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy"
- ‚úÖ Submit button should be disabled

### 3. 5-MINUTE INACTIVITY TIMEOUT

**Test Steps:**
1. Log in to user dashboard
2. Wait 4 minutes without any activity (no mouse movement, clicks, etc.)
3. Wait 1 more minute

**Expected Results:**
- ‚è∞ At 4 minutes: Warning toast appears
- üîí At 5 minutes: Auto-logout occurs
- ‚úÖ Redirected to login page
- ‚úÖ Toast shows "Session Expired" message

**Quick Test (for development):**
- Modify timeout to 10 seconds in `useInactivityTimeout.ts`
- Test with shorter timeframe

### 4. TERMS CHECKBOXES UI

**Test Steps:**
1. Open signup modal
2. Scroll to bottom of form

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Two checkboxes visible
- ‚úÖ "Terms of Service" link present
- ‚úÖ "Privacy Policy" link present  
- ‚úÖ Both marked as required (*)
- ‚úÖ Submit button disabled until both checked
