# 🔧 Wallet Provider Crash Fix

## ❌ **Problem:**
The app is crashing with wallet provider errors preventing it from loading.

## ⚡ **Quick Fix Applied:**
Added try-catch to wallet adapter initialization to prevent crashes.

## 🔄 **Next Steps:**

1. **The dev server is restarting in the background**
2. **Wait 10-15 seconds for it to finish**
3. **Refresh browser:** `Ctrl + Shift + R`
4. **App should load now**

## 💡 **What Was Changed:**
- Wrapped wallet adapter initialization in try-catch
- Added StrictMode for better error catching
- Wallets will gracefully fail if they can't initialize

## ✅ **Expected Result:**
- App loads successfully
- If wallet adapters fail, they return empty array
- Rest of app functions normally
- Wallet features may need manual connection

**Just wait for server to restart and refresh!** 🚀
