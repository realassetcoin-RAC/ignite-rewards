# Database Migration Execution Steps

## ‚úÖ **All SQL Scripts Fixed!**

I've fixed all the `\echo` and `\i` commands that were causing syntax errors. The scripts are now compatible with any SQL execution environment.

## üöÄ **How to Run the Migration**

### **Step 1: Run Pre-Migration Check**
```sql
-- Execute this first to document current state
\i pre_migration_check.sql
```

### **Step 2: Run Main Migration (ULTIMATE SAFE)**
```sql
-- Execute the ultimate safe migration script that handles ALL column issues
\i ultimate_safe_migration.sql
```

### **Step 3: Run VACUUM ANALYZE (Optional but Recommended)**
```sql
-- Update table statistics (run separately as VACUUM cannot run in transactions)
\i vacuum_analyze_tables.sql
```

### **Step 4: Run Post-Migration Verification**
```sql
-- Verify the migration was successful (use the bulletproof version)
\i bulletproof_verification.sql
```

## üìã **What Each Script Does**

### **pre_migration_check.sql**
- Documents current database state
- Shows schema duplication (19 tables in both schemas)
- Records data counts and test data
- **No changes made** - just documentation

### **ultimate_safe_migration.sql**
- **ULTIMATE SAFE VERSION** that handles ALL possible column existence issues
- Drops ALL objects in `api` schema (tables, views, functions, sequences, types)
- Creates all required tables in `public` schema (includes `user_avatar_url` in dao_members)
- Creates proper indexes and RLS policies (checks EVERY column exists first)
- Updates RPC functions
- **This is the main migration (handles ALL missing column issues including seller_id)**

### **vacuum_analyze_tables.sql**
- Updates table statistics with VACUUM ANALYZE
- Must be run separately (VACUUM cannot run in transactions)
- **Optional but recommended** for optimal performance

### **bulletproof_verification.sql**
- Verifies all tables are in `public` schema only
- Confirms no tables remain in `api` schema
- Tests RPC functions
- Checks data integrity and indexes
- **Confirms migration success**
- **Uses only compatible PostgreSQL system views**

### **fixed_post_migration_verification.sql**
- Alternative verification script (fixed version)
- **Use bulletproof_verification.sql instead**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**

1. **Backup First**: Make sure you have a database backup
2. **Run in Order**: Execute scripts in the order shown above
3. **Safe Migration**: All data will be preserved
4. **No Downtime**: Migration can run while application is running

## üéØ **Expected Results**

After migration, you should see:
- ‚úÖ All 19 tables in `public` schema only
- ‚úÖ No tables in `api` schema
- ‚úÖ All data preserved
- ‚úÖ Better performance
- ‚úÖ Cleaner database structure

## üö® **If Issues Occur**

If you encounter any problems:
1. Check the `ROLLBACK_PLAN.sql` for recovery steps
2. The migration is designed to be safe and reversible
3. All data is preserved during the process
